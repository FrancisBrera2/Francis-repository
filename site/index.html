<h2> Formula of Love: let s discuss about this amazing album </h2>

<p class="indent"> </p>

<p>
  Formula of Love is the latest TWICE album, with Scientist as the main track, I personally love it, and has become one of my favourite songs and MVs of the group, the girls really challenge themsleves every time with new type of music, this time they tried a Deep House genre.

<p> For my sadness, the song is not achieving the results expected like for The Feels and so I am wondering why this song is not reaching the same level of popularity, that s why we are here today.</p>

 <p> Let s examine together some possible causes </p>
<ul>
  <li> The sound: The sound of Scientist is fresh with a modern vibe and the videoclip is in my opinion one of their best MVs until now, I personally love the music too, but unfortunately the Deep House style is relevaing not to attract a part the majority of people that, I can t understand this, but acutally I am a EDM fan myself so maybe is normal that I enjoy the song so much, but maybe is not a genre that is appealing the majority of people, seems like that compared to the feels, the chorus is less memorable for the people, If i try to put myself in other shoes I may understand that "Boya boya I know" can be a bit more catchy than "Love aint a science" </li>
